1) The precedence of the symbols can't be changed. It remains the same as before.
2) We cant change The no. of operands an operator takes. Though we can choose to ignore operarands.
3) Except function call operator, no other operator can have default parameters.
4) The number of parameters that can be taken by an overloaded operator is fixed.
5) Operators like '?' './' '*/' '.' cant be overloaded.
6) except ovreloading of '=' operator, all the other operator overloading will be inherited by derived classes also.
7) As well as overloaded base class operator can be overriden by derived class operator overload function.
8) tip: Do not overload operators to perform a different task other than there meaning, It will make the code difficult to understand.
